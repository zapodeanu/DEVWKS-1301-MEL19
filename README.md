- Webex Teams account
- GitHub account
- ServiceNow developer account (optional)
- DevNet CSR1000V sandbox â€“ provided, or reserved by you here: https://developer.cisco.com/site/sandbox/
- You will need Python 2.7 and 3.x installed
- requests and ncclient libraries

**The repo includes these files**

- config.py - configuration file that includes accounts username and password
- eem_cli_config.txt - cli configuration for the CSR1000V router that will be used during the workshop
- save_base_config.py - script to establish the baseline configuration

**Application Workflow**

- User makes IOS XE device configuration change
- Syslog triggers EEM Guest Shell Python script execution
- The config_change.py script will:
    - Detect if a configuration change
    - Collect the device hostname using RESTCONF
    - Identify the user that made the change using Python CLI
    - Identify the configuration changes
    - Create Webex Teams room using REST APIs, invite Approver to room, post the above information to ask for approval
    - If changes approved, save new configuration as baseline
    - If not approved or no response, rollback to the previous baseline configuration
    - Close the Webex Teams room in 30 seconds (it is used for the Approval Process)
    - Create ServiceNow incident to record all the above information
